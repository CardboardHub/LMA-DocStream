# LMA DocStream

**Standardizing Loan Documentation at the Source**

LMA DocStream is a desktop-based prototype built for the **LMA Edge Hackathon** in the *Loan Documents* category.  
It demonstrates how standardized contract templates, structured document checklists, and AI-assisted analysis can modernize loan documentation workflows across the loan lifecycle.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Loan documentation is one of the most manual, inconsistent, and risk-heavy parts of the loan market.  
LMA DocStream addresses this by introducing a **standardized, intelligent documentation workflow** designed for scalability, efficiency, and transparency.

The prototype focuses on **commercial viability and clarity**, not legal precision.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. Standardized Loan Agreement Template
- Pre-structured, modular contract sections:
  - Parties  
  - Facility details  
  - Interest & fees  
  - Covenants  
  - Events of default  
  - Definitions  
- Clear section separation and navigation
- Editable text fields (prototype-level)

---

### 2. Document Checklist
- Structured checklist of required supporting documents
- Example items:
  - Credit Agreement  
  - Term Sheet  
  - Security Documents  
  - Corporate Approvals  
  - KYC / Compliance Documents  
- Status indicators:
  - Not Uploaded  
  - Uploaded  
  - Under Review  

---

### 3. AI-Assisted Document Analysis (Simulated)
- Highlights key clauses (e.g. governing law, maturity)
- Validates presence of required sections
- Flags potential inconsistencies (mocked logic)

> Note: AI outputs are simulated for demonstration purposes.

---

### 4. Standardized Loan Summary
- Structured output generated from the contract and documents
- Includes:
  - Borrower / Lender  
  - Facility type  
  - Amount  
  - Maturity date  
  - Governing law  
  - Key covenants (summary)  
  - Document completion status  

This is the primary output shown in the demo.
